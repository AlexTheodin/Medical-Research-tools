Alexis PDF Data Grabber

The developer of this program, Alexis Theodorou, was once faced with the daunting task of manually extracting data from numerous PDF files for a research project. In a moment of despair, he turned to ChatGPT, his trusty language model, for help. Together, they developed PDF Data Grabber, a tool that automates the data extraction process and saves researchers from the mind-numbing task of sifting through mountains of PDF files. And so, another human task falls prey to the unstoppable march of technology...

The PDF Data Grabber Program is a standalone program that allows users to extract data from PDF files easily. The program is designed to help researchers and professionals who need to extract data from PDF files quickly and efficiently.

To use the program, simply follow these steps:
1. Start the program by running the executable file.
2. Click on the "Start" button to begin the extraction process.
3. Add the labels you wish to extract by typing them in the "Label" field, and specifying an endpoint or a pattern. The endpoint is the text that comes after the label, while the pattern is a regular expression that matches the data you want to extract.
4. Choose the folder containing the PDF files by clicking on the "Select PDF Folder" button.
5. Choose where you want to save the output file by clicking on the "Save Output File As" button.
6. Click on the "Extract Data" button to start the extraction process.
7. Wait for the program to finish processing the PDF files.
8. Once the program is finished, a message box will appear telling you that the data has been successfully extracted and saved to the output file.
Tips for Maximizing Effectiveness:
* It is recommended that you save the output file in a different folder than the PDF files to avoid any potential conflicts.
* Use clear and concise labels to ensure that the program can extract the data accurately.
* If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improving the program, please email me at rombers@hotmail.com.
* 
Note: The program is currently unable to remove the brackets around extracted data and still record multiple appearances of labels. If you are able to solve this issue, please send the code to rombers@hotmail.com. I would be grateful for this as it apparently exceeds both my own non existent coding skills and the ability to give the correct prompts to my AI friend.
